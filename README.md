# MaxFileSizeOverride

A Vencord user plugin that uses GoFile API for increasing the file upload size without Discord nitro.


## How to use

when you want to upload a file just type in the channel you want to send the message:
```javascript
/bigupload 'file'
```
the file parameter returns the discord file attatchment box, just attatch the file and it will be uploaded.
Afterwards you will recieve a Discord bot message containing the file public URL

## Planned upgrades

In near future I plan to add theese features:

- UI alert/modal notifying the user that file is being uploaded ❌
- More providers ❌
- Fixing static server selection ❌
- If possible changing the Discord bot message for something more practical ❌
